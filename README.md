# Echo's Termux Packages
A shell file with necessary packages for Termux on Android!!

# How to use 
**(you have to install wget before downloading the .sh file!!!)**
install wget with
```pkg install wget```
(update your packages with ```pkg update ``` then ```pkg upgrade``` first)
then run
```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EchoNya/Echo-Termux-Packages/refs/heads/main/install.sh``` (copy and paste)
and then run
```bash install.sh```
to install the packages
**This is completely safe and it doesn't delete system files nor creates dangerous files. It just installs packages through termux's pkg command**
(Btw the "yes |" before the install command confirms every dialog automatically)
# What does it include?

Nano - A simple text editor
Neofetch - Displays your device's specs
Zip and Unzip - Zip utilities
Python - Run .py files and install packages with ```pip install```
w3m - A lightweight browser inside your termux terminal
git - Clone github repos with ```git clone 'link'```
